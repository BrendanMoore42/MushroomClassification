# MushroomClassification
Predicting Poisonous vs. Edibility in Mushrooms

#### Synopsis 
The following analysis will explore the kaggle Mushroom Classification dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/mushroom-classification). Several ML models will be explored for their ability to classify mushrooms as poisonous or edible based off of the provided data. 

Both unsupervised and supervised methods will be used, as well as regression and ensemble methods for a rounded look at how different models work with categorical datasets. 

#### Mushrooms:
Mushrooms come in all shapes, sizes, colours, and flavours--as the saying goes: every mushroom is edible at least <i>once</i>.

Mushroom identification is a multifaceted process, where several important features of the fruiting body are taken into account before determining edibility. In addition to physical factors, the time of season and where a mushroom fruits (dirt, grass, manure, on a tree, on a fallen log, etc.) are also important considerations when id'ing fungi. Id'ing should always be done by an experienced mushroom hunter with local knowledge. 

#### Quick Poisonous Mushroom Identifiers
* Spore Print: Spores are collected by placing a mushroom cap facedown over a sheet of paper or mirror. Different species' spores will be specific shades/colours, for example genus <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amanita"><i>Amanita</i></a> will spore print white--poison. 
* Fruiting Body: Several dispersal mechanisms for spores have evolved; between gilled, porous, sac or puffball fungi poisonous species may all mimic edible look-a-likes. 
* Bruising/Color: Certain species that bruise dark when handled can sometimes indicate poison or inedibility. 
* Morphology: 
   * The genus <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amanita"><i>Amanita</i></a> carries some of the some deadliest mushrooms in the world. Destroying Angel, Death Cap and Fool's Mushroom are all fatal, however share characteristics of the Amanita class making them easily identifiable. While the cap colour may alter, typically White cap, gills, and spore print, along with a physical structure called the volva are telltale signs of  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amanita"><i>Amanita's</i></a>. 
   * The genus <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyromitra_esculenta"><i>Gyromitra</i></a>, better known as the False Morel, is an example of a poisonous mushroom that looks like the famously delicious Morel. Inexperienced mushroom hunters could potentially mix this type of mushroom up with an edible counterpart and suffer the consequences. However, false morels have a full stem and are tellingly <i>not</i> hollow.
